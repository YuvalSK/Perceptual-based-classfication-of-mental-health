# Perceptual-based-classfication-of-mental-health
## In this project, we used Conditional Tabular Generative Adversial Networks (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data. This data was used to improve perceptual-based classification of psychoatric (or mental) state over binarized groups. See the 'NN_project_main' notebook for our implementation. 
### Briefly, we attained accuarcy of 0.7 AUC using Random Forest (with K-fold).
### We found that MLP is suprior, with AUC of 0.81. This was improved using synthetic data for up to 0.867.
