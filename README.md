# Perceptual-based-classfication-of-mental-health
## In this project, we used Conditional Tabular Generative Adversial Networks (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data. This data was used to improve perceptual-based classification of psychoatric (or mental) state over binarized groups. See the 'NN_project_main' notebook for our implementation.
